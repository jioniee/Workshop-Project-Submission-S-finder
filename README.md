## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Music has been a cultural product since AD 1. This form is a way to convey and express feelings. As time goes on, more and more outstanding musicians have created one classic and popular song after another. After being sung and rewritten from generation to generation, the song itself can move people's hearts or express higher spiritual significance. Music can inspire people, give them hope, make them believe in something better, or keep them away for a while. When you need it, it will be your good friend, when you need it, you will find it. The proverb "Put on the music, pause the memory, stop the pain, put the joy back" is the easiest thing to do. Music is a means of connecting all cultures. Different cultures have music, and we can easily see how different cultures are combined.

It is because of modern people's strong desire and need for music that many music apps related to it have emerged. In the age of information explosion, the huge network resources provide great convenience for our daily life. Whether it's pop, rock, folk, electronica, jazz, absolute music, rap, metal, world music, New Age, classical, indie, ambient music and so on. According to the school. But, sometimes, if you have more choices, then it's hard to find your favourite song in a big pile. Many music apps recognize this problem and offer smart personalized advice to help them find their hobbies and preferences. However, the current recommendation system on the music market is not perfect, and the types of songs obtained by users are often single, which will produce the effect of "cocoon" over time.

Our project team wanted to solve recommendation flexibility problem in NetEase Cloud Music platforms. Our intelligent recommendation system can conveniently help users to choose a new singer and his or her songs to enjoy. Only provided users’ NetEase Cloud Music URL of your favourite playlist, the recommendation system will provide users some best choices according to their existing music in a real and short time. 

We used crawl skill to scrape a large amount of music in NetEase Cloud Music platform to build a dataset. After gaining a large amount of information from some dimension of music, we selected several features, such as ‘singer’, ‘category’, ‘release time’, ‘lyrics emotion’ and so on. Firstly, we decreased the dimensions of features by PCA, and then we collected user’s information and found the most suitable music by Item-KNN algorithm which will be recommended to users. Besides, we designed a fresh and NetEase Cloud Music-type-like interface to make users have a better search experience.

Our team has a clear work distribution and feels very happy to work together to create such an intelligent system. And definitely we hope our project can be put into commercial use and be used and receive feedback by more users. We can also upgrade the database in real time and may set a database for users in the future if more and more users are willing to use our commendation system.
